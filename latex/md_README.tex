\subsection*{Description}

In this project, we had to write various search algorithms and compare their efficiency with one another. We had to write algorithms for iterative and recursive linear, binary and ternary search, jump search and Fibonacci search. We also had to answer a few questions, such as which linear algorithm works best between linear and jump search and the Fibonacci search algorithm\textquotesingle{}s worst case.
