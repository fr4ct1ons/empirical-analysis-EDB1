# empirical-analysis-EDB1
Repository for a college project, about an empirical analysis on various search algorithms' speed.

Subject: Estrutura de Dados Básicas I (Basic Data Structures I)  
Teacher: Selan Rodrigues Santos  

## About
In this project, we had to write various search algorithms and compare their efficiency with one another. We had to write algorithms for iterative and recursive linear, binary and ternary search, jump search and Fibonacci search.  
We also had to answer a few questions, such as which linear algorithm works best between linear and jump search and the Fibonacci search algorithm's worst case.

## Installation
1. Download the files  
2. On the terminal, move to the directory you put the project's files at  
3. Run the program using `./searchAlgsTester`  

*You can also run the program like `./searchAlgsTester <size of the array> <value to search> <search algorithm to use> `  

## Usage license of the searchAlgs.cpp and searchAlgs.h files
Feel free to use and edit the searchAlgs.cpp files for your own purposes at will. However, I do require that you please give me credit for the library and include the contact info below.

## Errors
Currently, the program has no known errors.
